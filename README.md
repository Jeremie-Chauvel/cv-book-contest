## Purpose

The fundamental goal is to showcase that, it's possible to create a basic portfolio personal website hosted on [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages) in about 1h. (-> 2h with some optimizations for Speed, SEO and accessibility).

Example following this tutorial [jeremie-chauvel.github.io](https://jeremie-chauvel.github.io)

## Steps for creating the portfolio website

- I read and followed the great tutorial: [How To Build a Portfolio On GitHub Pages](https://codeburst.io/how-to-build-a-portfolio-on-github-pages-2daaf5ded5e3) which is about ~30min.
  - I chose a theme ~5min.
  - I wrote some content ~10min.
  - I created the repository to publish my page ~5min.
- I searched pretty pictures on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) ~30min.
- I [cropped the images](https://youtu.be/hfhJcIGH4o0) to a correct form factor using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) ~5-10min (depending on my theme, watch out for mobile)
- I resized the pictures (about 1500 pixels width corresponding to my theme) using GIMP as well ~5min.

(Bonus)

- I renamed the pictures to descriptive names (updating the HTML as well). ~ 2min
- I minified the [javascript](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS), [CSS](https://github.com/fmarcia/uglifycss) and [HTML](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier) using the linked nodejs tools ~1h.
  - Testing each step to check that I didn't broke the site.
  - It was the occasion to remove any extra js/css.
